# Sections: es6 check if element offsetTop

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/luisfrancisco02/pen/dZqvwj](https://codepen.io/luisfrancisco02/pen/dZqvwj).

First, I made this to understand how to fix and how to make a page, where the section with a top-bar, that is hide, check if the section is on top and then give a class 
'active' for the first child, top-bar in this case.

There is 2 versions, both works, but the one that is not in the comment, was made by Filipe Carmona Kiss (https://github.com/filipekiss).

You can use the last one to use, but if you follow the way I build the html.
Hope this help someone in the future.
